# Responsive Card design with HTML & CSS

In this responsive card design the DOM structure is like that:

main>container>imag and text container

both main and container use Flexbox css to create the columns.

flex direction column set top to bottom. It establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container.

The background-size CSS property sets the size of the element's background image. The image can be left to its natural size, stretched, or constrained to fit the available space.

Media query is used to change the two column to one row below 768 pixel.
